I created this readme file to practice writing Markdown.
Press Command+Shift+P to open command palette
Type Markdown: Open Preview
Select the applicable option

# h1 element Heading
## h2 element heading
### h3 element heading
up to
###### h6 element heading

You can add _emphasis_ to text by wrapping the text in underscores, and you can **bold** text by adding two asterisks on either side of the bolded text.

In GitHub markdown, you can add *emphasis* to text by wrapping the text in single asterisks or underscores, and you can __bold__ text by adding two asterisks or underscores on either side of the bolded text.

You can write code inline by wrapping text in a backtick. This helps distinguish the code, like `let x = 10;` from other text.

```javascript
function hello(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```
